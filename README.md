Analytics Data Competition 2023 - Problem Statement
This is the problem statement for Phase One of the 2023 Higher Education Analytics Data Competition. The competition focuses on analyzing accessible transportation services in Hamilton, Canada, with the goal of improving the customer experience for persons with disabilities using public transit.

## Background
The City of Hamilton provides accessible transportation services (ATS) to individuals with disabilities. The service includes door-to-door transportation for clients who qualify, with both subscription trips and casual trips available. Subscription trips are booked for recurring medical appointments or other activities, while casual trips can be reserved seven days in advance. Clients may have shared travel with other customers en route to their destinations.

ATS allows clients to travel within Hamilton, cross municipal boundaries to places like Burlington and Niagara, and connect with other services like GO Transit. In such cases, clients may be dropped off at GO stations or connected to services at the outskirts of the boundary.

## Problem Description
The objective of the competition is to convert ATS trip data into actionable insights that can enhance the flexibility and quality of service for persons with disabilities. The provided dataset for the year 2019 contains 844,007 trips. Participants are encouraged to combine this data with additional open data sources, such as Hamilton Street Railway (HSR) open data and transit feeds, to generate deeper insights.

## Potential questions to explore include:

- How do some trips align with the existing HSR service?
- What are the major trip destinations and the wards they originate from?
- How many trips cross urban and regional boundaries?
- Are there any demographic patterns among the clients?
- Can rural clients be brought to the urban transit boundary?
- Is there an opportunity for community bussing in specific areas?
- Can on-demand service for ATS be supported?
- What is the potential impact of the future LRT (Light Rail Transit) corridor?
- How far do people travel, and what is the average trip duration?
- How does trip duration compare to conventional travel via HSR or car?
- What is the rate of travel per hour?
- Participants are encouraged to analyze the data, clean and transform it if necessary, and leverage other relevant datasets to develop meaningful insights and tell a compelling story.

## Data and Resources
The competition website (https://datacompetition.mohawkcollege.ca) provides access to the necessary datasets and additional links to assist with the analysis. The data is password-protected, and the password for accessing the data is "2023ProblemData". Participants are prohibited from sharing the problem information or distributing it outside their team.

## Competition Phases
Phase One of the competition focuses on analyzing the provided data and generating insights. Qualifying teams will move on to Phase Two, where they will receive more details closer to the date.

## Competition Guidelines
The competition is for student participants, and analysis should be performed by students.
Mentors are available for guidance, but the work should be primarily done by the participants.
Posters should be submitted electronically in landscape or portrait orientation, with recommended sizes of 36”L x 48”W or 48”L x 36”W.
